# Containerizing a Node microservice with Docker

Code for the library web service is found in the
`library-microservice` directory. <br>

The service manages authors and books, providing
endpoints to get author details and books that they have written. <br>

To build and run the web service, navigate to
[./library-microservice/](./library-microservice/) and follow the instructions
in the README.md file. <br>

## Client application

Navigate to [./client-application/](./client-application/) to view the code for the
simple client application. <br>

The client application loads the results from every
service endpoint in the library microservice. <br>
